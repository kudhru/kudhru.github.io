<!-- I am currently an assistant professor at [IIIT Delhi](https://iiitd.ac.in/). In the Past, I was a Post-Doc Researcher at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/). Prior to Post-Doc, I completed my PhD under [Abhishek Chandra](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~chandra/) in the [Computer Science Department](https://cse.umn.edu/cs) at the [University of Minnesota, Twin Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/). During my PhD, I also collaborated with [Ramesh Sitaraman](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/ramesh/) at [University of Massachusetts, Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/). Long time back, I graduated in 2014 with a Bachelors in Computer Science from [BITS,Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/). -->

I am currently an assistant professor at IIIT, Delhi. In the Past, I was a Post-Doc Researcher at Microsoft Research. Prior to Post-Doc, I completed my PhD under [Abhishek Chandra](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~chandra/) in the Computer Science Department at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, USA. During my PhD, I also collaborated with [Ramesh Sitaraman](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/ramesh/) at University of Massachusetts, Amherst, USA. Long time back, I graduated in 2014 with a Bachelors in Computer Science from [BITS, Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/).

I consider myself a scientist before a computer scientist. Hence, I am interested in solving real life problems even if they are simple and/or not strictly related to computer science. I am particularly interested in solving problems which are specific to developing countries such as India.  

As part of computer science research, I am interested in Distributed Systems and its application in Data Analytics and Machine Learning.
